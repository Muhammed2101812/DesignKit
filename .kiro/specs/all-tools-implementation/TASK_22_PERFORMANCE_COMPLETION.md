**Optimizations:**
```typescript
// Canvas size optimization
const MAX_CANVAS_DIMENSION = 4096

// Canvas pooling
class CanvasPool {
  acquire(width, height): HTMLCanvasElement
  release(canvas): void
}

// Context optimization
ctx.imageSmoothingEnabled = true
ctx.imageSmoothingQuality = 'high'
```

**Performance Impact:**

|---------|----------|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Fast 3G | 1.6 Mbps | 750 Kbps | 562.5ms | 8-12s |
| Slow 3G | 400 Kbps | 400 Kbps | 2000ms | 20-30s |
| 4G | 4 Mbps | 3 Mbps | 170ms | 5-8s |
| WiFi | 30 Mbps | 15 Mbps | 28ms | 3-5s |
