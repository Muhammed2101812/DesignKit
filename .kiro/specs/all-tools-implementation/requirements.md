# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing all remaining design tools in the Design Kit application. The application currently has only the Color Picker tool implemented. This feature will complete the implementation of all 10 tools: 6 client-side tools (processing files entirely in the browser) and 4 API-powered tools (requiring server-side processing with quota management).

The implementation must maintain the privacy-first approach for client-side tools, implement proper quota management for API tools, ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 Level AA), and provide a consistent user experience across all tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Client-Side Tools Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use privacy-first image processing tools that work entirely in my browser, so that my files never leave my device and I can process images without internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the Image Cropper tool, THE Design Kit SHALL provide an interface to upload an image, select aspect ratios (free, 1:1, 4:3, 16:9, custom), crop the image using draggable handles, and download the cropped result in the original format.

2. WHEN a user accesses the Image Resizer tool, THE Design Kit SHALL provide an interface to upload an image, specify target dimensions (width and height in pixels or percentage), maintain aspect ratio option, preview the resized image, and download in the original format.

3. WHEN a user accesses the Format Converter tool, THE Design Kit SHALL provide an interface to upload an image, select target format (PNG, JPG, WEBP), adjust quality settings for lossy formats, preview the converted image, and download in the selected format.

4. WHEN a user accesses the QR Generator tool, THE Design Kit SHALL provide an interface to input text or URL (up to 500 characters), customize QR code appearance (size, foreground color, background color, error correction level), preview the generated QR code, and download as PNG or SVG.

5. WHEN a user accesses the Gradient Generator tool, THE Design Kit SHALL provide an interface to select gradient type (linear or radial), add multiple color stops (minimum 2, maximum 10), adjust color stop positions, set gradient angle for linear gradients, preview the gradient in real-time, copy CSS code, and export as PNG image.

6. WHILE processing files in any client-side tool, THE Design Kit SHALL perform all operations using the Canvas API in the browser without uploading files to any server.

7. WHEN a user uploads a file to any client-side tool, THE Design Kit SHALL validate file type (image/png, image/jpeg, image/webp, image/gif), validate file size (maximum 50MB for Free plan, 100MB for Premium/Pro), and display clear error messages for invalid files.
