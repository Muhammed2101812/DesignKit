# Task 1 Completion: Environment Variables and Security Configuration

## Summary

Successfully implemented environment variables validation and security configuration for the Design Kit project. All required services (Stripe, Upstash Redis, Sentry, Resend) are now properly configured with Zod schema validation and comprehensive security headers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `lib/env.ts`

Added environment variable validation for:

**Stripe (Payment Processing)**
- `STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID` - Premium plan price ID
- `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID` - Pro plan price ID

**Upstash Redis (Rate Limiting)**
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` - Redis REST API URL
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN` - Redis authentication token

**Sentry (Error Tracking)**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` - Client-side error tracking DSN
- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` - Server-side auth token for source maps
- `SENTRY_ORG` - Sentry organization slug
- `SENTRY_PROJECT` - Sentry project name

**Resend (Email Service)**
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key for transactional emails
- `EMAIL_FROM` - Verified sender email address

**Application**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Application base URL for redirects

All variables are properly typed with Zod schemas and validated at runtime with appropriate error handling during build time.

### 2. Updated `next.config.js`

Added comprehensive security headers:

**Security Headers Implemented:**
- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control` - Enable DNS prefetching
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Force HTTPS with 2-year max-age
- `X-Frame-Options` - Prevent clickjacking (SAMEORIGIN)
- `X-Content-Type-Options` - Prevent MIME sniffing
- `X-XSS-Protection` - Enable XSS filter
- `Referrer-Policy` - Control referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` - Disable unnecessary browser features

**Content Security Policy (CSP):**
- `default-src 'self'` - Only allow same-origin by default
- `script-src` - Allow scripts from self, Stripe, and CDNs
- `style-src` - Allow inline styles (required for Tailwind)
- `img-src` - Allow images from all HTTPS sources, data URIs, and blobs
- `font-src` - Allow fonts from self and data URIs
- `connect-src` - Allow connections to Supabase, Stripe, Remove.bg, Replicate, Upstash, and Sentry
- `frame-src` - Allow Stripe iframes
- `object-src 'none'` - Block plugins
- `base-uri 'self'` - Restrict base tag
- `form-action 'self'` - Restrict form submissions
- `frame-ancestors 'none'` - Prevent embedding
- `upgrade-insecure-requests` - Upgrade HTTP to HTTPS

### 3. Updated `.env.example`

Enhanced documentation for all environment variables:

**Upstash Redis Section:**
- Added detailed setup instructions
- Clarified REST API credentials
- Noted optional in development, required in production

**Resend Email Section:**
- Replaced generic email section with Resend-specific configuration
- Added API key format and verification requirements
- Included alternative SendGrid option

**Sentry Section:**
- Expanded with detailed configuration instructions
- Added all required variables (DSN, auth token, org, project)
- Included optional environment and release variables
- Clarified which keys are client-safe vs server-only

**Stripe Section:**
- Added price ID configuration for Premium and Pro plans
- Included instructions for creating products in Stripe Dashboard

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 8.5**: File upload validation with type and size checks
- CSP headers restrict file sources and enforce security policies

✅ **Requirement 8.6**: Content Security Policy headers in next.config.js
- Comprehensive CSP implemented with all necessary directives
- XSS protection, clickjacking prevention, and HTTPS enforcement

## Verification

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful for `lib/env.ts`
- ✅ All environment variables properly typed with Zod schemas
- ✅ Security headers configured in Next.js config
- ✅ `.env.example` updated with comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

The environment configuration is now ready for:
1. **Task 2**: Database schema updates (subscriptions, tool_usage, daily_limits)
2. **Task 3**: Rate limiting infrastructure implementation using Upstash Redis
3. **Task 5**: Sentry error tracking integration
4. **Task 29**: Resend email client configuration

## Notes

- All new environment variables are marked as optional to maintain backward compatibility
- Build-time validation includes graceful handling for missing optional variables
- Security headers are production-ready and follow OWASP best practices
- CSP allows necessary third-party services while maintaining strict security posture
