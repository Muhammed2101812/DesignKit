### Technical Implementation

#### Avatar Upload Flow
```typescript
1. User selects file → Validation (type, size)
2. Create preview → Display to user
3. On save → Upload to Supabase Storage
4. Get public URL → Update profile record
5. Update local state → Show success message
```

#### File Validation
```typescript
- Allowed types: image/png, image/jpeg, image/webp
- Maximum size: 2MB (2 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
- Validation before upload to prevent wasted bandwidth
```

#### Usage Statistics Query
```typescript
- Queries daily_limits table for current date
- Shows 0/10 if no record exists
- Updates in real-time when operations are performed
- Only visible for free plan users
```

### Database Schema Used

#### Profiles Table
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- email (TEXT)
- full_name (TEXT, nullable)
- avatar_url (TEXT, nullable)
- plan (TEXT: 'free' | 'premium' | 'pro')
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

#### Daily Limits Table
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key)
- date (DATE)
- api_tools_count (INTEGER)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

#### Storage Bucket
```sql
- Bucket name: avatars
- Public: true
- RLS enabled: true
- Policies: Upload/Update/Delete own, Read all
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Row Level Security**: Users can only update their own profile
2. **File Validation**: Client-side validation prevents invalid uploads
3. **Storage Policies**: Users can only manage their own avatars
4. **Input Sanitization**: Full name is trimmed before saving
5. **Error Messages**: Generic messages to prevent information leakage

### User Experience

1. **Loading States**: Spinner shown during data fetch and save operations
2. **Visual Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/error states
3. **Preview**: Avatar preview before upload
4. **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. **Accessibility**: Proper labels and ARIA attributes

### Setup Required

Before using this feature, run the storage migration:

```bash
# Apply the migration
supabase db push

# Or manually create the bucket in Supabase Dashboard
# Storage → New Bucket → Name: "avatars" → Public: true
```
