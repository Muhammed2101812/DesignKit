- Arrow icon translation on hover
- Consistent spacing and typography

### 5. Loading States

#### Skeleton Component
- Created reusable `Skeleton` component
- Pulse animation for loading indication
- Consistent with design system colors

#### Color Picker Skeleton
- Created `ColorPickerSkeleton` component
- Mimics actual layout structure
- Smooth fade-in animation

### 6. Spacing & Typography

#### Design Tokens
- Created `lib/utils/design-tokens.ts` with consistent values
- Defined spacing scale (xs to 4xl)
- Typography scale (xs to 7xl)
- Animation durations and easing functions
- Border radius values
- Shadow definitions

#### Consistency
- All components use consistent spacing
- Typography follows defined scale
- Animations use standard durations

### 7. Accessibility

#### Focus States
- Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements
- Ring offset for better visibility
- Keyboard navigation support

#### Screen Readers
- Proper ARIA labels on theme toggle
- Skip to main content link
- Semantic HTML structure

### 8. Performance

#### Optimizations
- CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations
- Hardware-accelerated transforms (scale, translate)
- Efficient animation durations (150-300ms)
- Minimal repaints and reflows

## Files Modified

- `components/marketing/Features.tsx` - Hover effects
- `components/marketing/ToolsGrid.tsx` - Card animations
- `components/marketing/Pricing.tsx` - Scale effects
- `components/marketing/CTA.tsx` - Button animations

## Animation Guidelines

### Duration Standards
- **Fast (150ms)**: Micro-interactions (button press, checkbox)
- **Normal (200ms)**: Standard transitions (hover, focus)
- **Slow (300ms)**: Content appearance (fade-in, slide-in)
- **Slower (500ms)**: Complex animations (page transitions)

### Easing Functions
- **Default**: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` - Smooth in-out
- **In**: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)` - Accelerate
- **Out**: `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1)` - Decelerate
- **InOut**: `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` - Smooth both ends

### Best Practices
1. Use `transform` and `opacity` for animations (GPU-accelerated)
2. Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` (causes reflow)
3. Keep animations under 300ms for responsiveness
4. Provide reduced motion support for accessibility
5. Use `animation-fill-mode: backwards` for staggered animations

## Dark Mode Colors

### Updated Palette
- **Primary**: Changed to blue (`217 91% 60%`) for better visibility
- **Ring**: Matches primary color for consistency
- **Background**: Deep blue-gray for reduced eye strain
- **Foreground**: High contrast white for readability

### Contrast Ratios
All color combinations meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)

- Smooth, professional animations
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Full dark mode support
- Accessible interactions
- Performance-optimized transitions
- Loading states for better perceived performance

All changes maintain the existing functionality while improving visual polish and user delight.
