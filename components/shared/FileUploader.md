# FileUploader Component Implementation

## Overview

The FileUploader component has been successfully implemented as a reusable, accessible, and user-friendly file upload component with drag-and-drop functionality and comprehensive validation.

## Files Created

### 1. `components/shared/FileUploader.tsx`
The main component implementation with the following features:
- ✅ Drag-and-drop functionality with visual feedback
- ✅ Click to browse file selection
- ✅ File type validation (MIME types and extensions)
- ✅ File size validation with configurable limits
- ✅ Single or multiple file selection support
- ✅ Selected file display with name, size, and clear button
- ✅ Inline error messages for validation failures
- ✅ Accessible keyboard navigation
- ✅ Disabled state support
- ✅ Responsive design

### 2. `lib/utils/fileValidation.ts`
Utility functions for file validation:
- `validateFile()` - Validates files against type and size constraints
- `formatFileSize()` - Formats bytes to human-readable format (Bytes, KB, MB, GB)
- `getAcceptedTypesLabel()` - Converts accept string to readable label

### 3. `components/shared/FileUploader.example.tsx`
Comprehensive usage examples demonstrating:
- Basic image upload
- Multiple files upload
- Image upload with preview
- PDF upload
- Large file upload (video)
- Disabled state
- Form integration

### 4. `lib/utils/__tests__/fileValidation.test.ts`
Unit tests for file validation utilities (requires Jest setup to run)

### 5. `app/test-file-uploader/page.tsx`
Interactive test page to visually verify all component features

### 6. Updated `components/shared/README.md`
Added comprehensive documentation for the FileUploader component

## Key Features

### Drag-and-Drop
- Visual feedback when dragging files over the drop zone
- Border color changes to primary color
- Background tint for better visibility
- Proper drag counter to handle nested elements

### File Validation
- **Type Validation**: Supports MIME types (`image/png`) and extensions (`.png`)
- **Wildcard Support**: Handles wildcards like `image/*` for all image types
- **Size Validation**: Configurable max size in megabytes
- **Error Messages**: Clear, user-friendly error messages

### User Experience
- **Visual States**: Default, drag active, file selected, error, and disabled
- **File Display**: Shows file name and formatted size
- **Clear Actions**: Individual file removal or clear all (multiple mode)
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

### Accessibility
- Hidden file input with proper `aria-label`
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly
- Focus indicators on interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { FileUploader } from '@/components/shared/FileUploader'

export default function MyComponent() {
  const handleFileSelect = (file: File | File[]) => {
    const selectedFile = Array.isArray(file) ? file[0] : file
    // Process the file
    console.log('Selected:', selectedFile)
  }

  return (
    <FileUploader
      onFileSelect={handleFileSelect}
      accept="image/png,image/jpeg,image/webp"
      maxSize={10}
      description="Upload an image to get started"
    />
  )
}
```

## Testing

To test the component:
1. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/test-file-uploader`
3. Test all six examples on the page

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies all requirements from task 10:
- ✅ Create FileUploader component with drag-and-drop functionality
- ✅ Implement file type validation based on accept prop
- ✅ Add file size validation with configurable maxSize prop
- ✅ Show visual feedback for drag active state
- ✅ Display selected file with name, size, and clear button
- ✅ Handle validation errors with inline error messages
- ✅ Support both single and multiple file selection

## Next Steps

The FileUploader component is ready to be integrated into tool pages, starting with:
- Task 11: Color Picker - File Upload and Canvas Setup
- Future tools that require file upload functionality

## Notes

- The component is privacy-first: files are only handled client-side
- No automatic upload to server - parent component controls what happens with files
- Fully typed with TypeScript for type safety
- Follows the Design Kit design system and patterns
